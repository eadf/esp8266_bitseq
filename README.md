#esp8266_bitseq

General purpose synchronized bit sampler for esp8266.

You can often find a hidden serial interface on your gadgets, it is used for in-factory testing and to sell you overpriced 'addons' with very limited functionality. 

This library you can help you sample that data and do whatever you like with it.

This is how the caliper sends data: one channel for the clock pulses and another for the data. 

These packages are usually separated by an idle period and then repeated. What this library does is to sample each databit at rising or falling clock pulse into a cyclic buffer. When it has aquired enough bits (configurable) and detected an idle period it will send your code a callback so that the data can be parsed and used.  

I've added examples where i connect a cheap digital caliper, a digital dial and a power plug energy meter to a mqtt message broker.

## Digital Caliper

The main inspiration for this sampler was this [blog.](https://sites.google.com/site/marthalprojects/home/arduino/arduino-reads-digital-caliper)

## Digital Dial

 [Justin R.](https://hackaday.io/hacker/1910-justin-r) wrote a really useful [blog](https://hackaday.io/project/511-digital-dial-indicator-cnc-surface-probe/log/814-the-digital-dial-indicator-and-how-to-read-from-it) about the digital dial that helped me a lot (no code though).

## Power plug energy meter

The energy meter is described in [Kalle LÃ¶fgrens blog] (http://gizmosnack.blogspot.se/2014/10/power-plug-energy-meter-hack.html).
Just be aware that there is 50% chance that the logic wires (including GND) in that power meter will be directly connected to 230V.
Don't even open the case if you don't know what you are doing.
