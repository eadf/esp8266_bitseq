#esp8266_bitseq
===========

General purpose synchronized bit sampler for esp8266.

You can often find a hidden serial interface on your gadgets, it is used for in-factory testing and to sell you overpriced 'addons' with very limited functionality. 

This library you can help you sample that data and do whatever you like with it.
You will still have to figure out the data protocol and write some adapter code.

I've added examples where i connect a cheap digital caliper, digital dial and a power plug energy meter to a mqtt message broker.

## Digital Caliper

The main inspiration for this sampler was this [blog](https://sites.google.com/site/marthalprojects/home/arduino/arduino-reads-digital-caliper)

## Digital Dial

 [Justin R.](https://hackaday.io/hacker/1910-justin-r) wrote a really useful [blog](https://hackaday.io/project/511-digital-dial-indicator-cnc-surface-probe/log/814-the-digital-dial-indicator-and-how-to-read-from-it) about the digital dial that helped me a lot (no code though).

## power-plug-energy-meter

The energy meter is described in [Kalle LÃ¶fgrens blog] (http://gizmosnack.blogspot.se/2014/10/power-plug-energy-meter-hack.html).
Just be aware that there is 50% chance that the logic wires (including GND) in that power meter will be directly connected to 230V.
Don't even open the case if you don't know what you are doing.
